### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Angular Basics
- Firebase 
- Serverless programming

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

The use of Directives. I learned that I can use Directives to alter the behaviour and appearance of an existing element in the DOM while creating the scrollable team members carousel
### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was exciting because I got the opportunity to close 3 issues with my partner on the elewa-group-website project

- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged and optimistic because I look forward to closing other issues in the coming week and learn in the process

- I find the project to be challenging as I continuously learn new concepts in angular and applying them on the issues selected.

- My level of stress is relaxed. I am solving one challenge at a time.
